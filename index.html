        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
            <p>Hello! My name is Ayla LaFrenere and I am a first year graphic design student at Algonquin College. I first was introduced to grphic design during the 
            pandemic. I was very bored and decided to look into possible career options in the art community...Only problem was I hate the fine arts. Not it in 
            general, I just don't enjoy spending hours on a piece just to not finish it cause I got bored. It's simply not for me, granted fine art is still 
            beautiful from a distance. With that, I was left with the horrid question "what do I want to do?" Well easy, I want to do art. So my search began and I 
            indulged my mom (after her saying repeatdly to me over and over again to check it out), I type Graphic Design into the search bar and the rest is history. 
            I was hooked.</p>
    
    
            <p>Now my love for Graphic Design really blossomed in my CO-OP program, where I worked at a tattoo shop. My job was to design tattoos for clients, some 
            were huge body pieces or others were walk-ins where I was challenged to come up with something quick and on the spot. It was a blast! It left me so 
            excited for what my future in design will look like.</p>
